        <p>The A380 is without doubt a large aircraft. As a result it does take longer than usual to board and disembark the aircraft. We had hoped that ours would have the configuration with the twin seats upstairs but unfortunately that wasn't the case. However the seats we chose, beforehand, were comfortable. The facilities are good with a large screen seatback TV with literally hundreds of different things to choose from. However we couldn't help thinking of the old saying about American TV - hundreds of channels and nothing on. We had no trouble finding overhead locker space. The food was very good and there was a good range on complimentary drinks. The staff on-board were efficient and friendly. This was a good flight and we can see why BlueSky have consistently been voted the No.1 Airline.<br /><a href="blog.html">Read more</a></p>
